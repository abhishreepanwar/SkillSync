## Quick Start (Demo Mode)

**Want to try SkillSync immediately?** It works perfectly without any API keys!

SkillSync will run in **demo mode** with high-quality simulated AI responses.

---

## Full AI Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies including AI libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Get Gemini API Key (Free)

1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key

### Step 3: Configure Environment

**Option A: Run the setup helper**
```bash
python config.py
```

**Option B: Manual setup**
```bash
# Create .env file in the backend folder
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

### Step 4: Start SkillSync

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ Gemini AI initialized successfully!
✅ SkillSync backend running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'speech_recognition'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub textblob numpy
```

### ❌ "Gemini API key not found"

This is normal! SkillSync works in demo mode. For full AI features:
1. Get API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add to `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### ❌ "Error with speech recognition service"

The app falls back to demo transcripts. For real speech recognition, ensure:
- Internet connection is available
- Audio files are in supported formats (.mp3, .wav, .m4a)

### ❌ Dependencies installation fails

Try installing step by step:
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors python-docx PyPDF2 docx2txt
pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub textblob  # Optional for audio
```
